It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"## The Problem\r\n\r\nThose of us with some type of diabetes (whether type 1, type 2, or\r\nmonogenic) take on the task of either partially or fully simulating the\r\nfunctioning of a biologically normal person's pancreas. In short, we\r\nbecome our own pancreases. The tools we have to do this today--analog\r\ninsulins, home blood glucose monitors, insulin pumps, and continuous\r\nblood glucose monitors--are much, much better than the tools that were\r\navailable to persons with diabetes (PWDs) even a generation ago.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, the tools at our disposal for managing the data that\r\nis associated with these devices and technologies are very poor indeed.\r\nSome are not available to everyone (the software for the Dexcom\r\ncontinuous glucose monitor only runs on the Windows operating system);\r\nsome are fiendishly difficult to operate (uploading data from an\r\nAnimas/OneTouch Ping insulin pump into the Animas ezManager software via\r\nthe late-1990s-technology of an *infrared* syncing cable is a trial in\r\ninfinite patience; this is not to mention that despite supposed\r\ncompatibility, I have not *ever* succeeded in getting the Animas\r\nezManager software to sync with the pump successfully on my iMac running\r\nOS X 10.7 Lion); many keep the data they produce locked away in\r\nproprietary formats or only offer exporting of data in formats\r\ninconvenient or downright useless (e.g., XML) for the average user.\r\n\r\nIn recent years since the introduction of the iPhone and the rising to\r\ndominance of the smart phone paradigm in the cell phone marketplace, a\r\nwhole host of \"logbook\" applications have been developed ostensibly to\r\nmake the management of diabetes-related data easier. However, nearly\r\nall--if not all (I speak from the position of having casually but not\r\nthoroughly surveyed the landscape)--of these applications continue to\r\nrequire a PWD to manually enter the data s/he wants to track. Given the\r\nfact that except on the most very basic of blood glucose meters, every\r\ntest performed on a blood glucose meter is stored in memory, this\r\nstrikes me as a completely unnecessary replication of effort. The act of\r\nperforming a blood glucose test is itself an act of record-making; to\r\nrequire that the PWD take the extra step of entering the result of this\r\ntest into a data-tracking application is *silly* and *wasteful*. The\r\nsame goes for insulin doses, at least where insulin pumps are involved.\r\n\r\n## My Solution\r\n\r\nAll of this is an introduction to the tools I'm developing in this\r\nrepository. The tools here all rely on the export formats that *are*\r\navailable from various diabetes devices. (At the moment, of course, this\r\nis limited to the devices I personally use.) My goal is to create\r\nsoftware tools that will be truly cross-platform, freely available (and\r\nopen source), and easy to use. The goal of these tools is to integrate\r\ndata regarding all aspects of life that affect diabetes (including\r\nmeals, carbohydrate counts, exercise, sleep, etc., as well as blood\r\nglucose readings and insulin doses) and present that data in engaging,\r\ninformative, and in appropriate cases interactive visualizations.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be involved in testing these software tools, you\r\nmay contact me via e-mail. Be aware that in their present state, the\r\ntools I've developed are **not yet user-friendly**: you need to be\r\nfamiliar with the command line in order to use these tools.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of (some of) the output from these tools is visible\r\n[here](examples/logbook.html). What's shown is two timelines for each day of data. (Right now there are five days of data shown in this example.) In the top timeline of each pair, you'll see:\r\n\r\n-   that day's data from my Dexcom continuous glucose monitor\r\n\r\n    -   This is the blue-gray line with shading underneath.\r\n    -   Moving your mouse over the graph shows you the readings at each\r\n        point.\r\n\r\n-   blood glucose measurements from my blood glucose meter\r\n\r\n    -   These are the bright coral dots.\r\n\r\n-   episodes of hypoglycemia, if any\r\n\r\n    -   These are the turquoise vertical overlays.\r\n    -   Clicking on each overlay produces a pop-up box that gives more information about the hypoglycemic event.\r\n\r\n-   low-carb meals and snacks\r\n\r\n    -   These are the red vertical lines.\r\n    -   Clicking on each line produces a pop-up box that describes the event in more detail.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom timeline of each pair, you'll see:\r\n\r\n-   records of my carbohydrate intake\r\n\r\n    -   These are the red overlays.\r\n    -   The logic behind the width of the these overlays is that it takes about 90-120 minutes (90 minutes precisely is what's shown in the graph) for blood glucose to peak after ingesting carbohydrates.\r\n    -   Clicking on the overlays allows you to see the carbohydrate count in grams\r\n        along with a description of what I ate and my assessment of the\r\n        confidence I have in the carbohydrate count.\r\n\r\n-   records of my bolus insulin intake\r\n\r\n    -   These are the blue-gray overlays.\r\n    -   These overlays are have a width of 4 hours to match the duration of insulin activity programmed into my insulin pump settings.\r\n    -   Clicking on the overlays allows you to see the amount of insulin I took as well as my reason (correction or meal) for taking it.\r\n\r\n-   records of my exercise\r\n\r\n    - These are the green overlays.\r\n    - The width of these overlays corresponds to the length of time that I spent exercising.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Jana E.
